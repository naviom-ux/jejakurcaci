Someone said that if you want to make people do the natural poses, don’t push them into the exact poses you want. Just let them relax and communicate with each other. You’ll see the magic afterwards.

Wanda and Izzan asked me to capture moments for their pre-wedding session. At that time, Izzan just got back from Finland and we only had a short amount of time to prepare the photoshoot because the wedding is in a couple of days. It was such a pleasure moment taking pictures of them during the photo session. They’re such a generous couple. I let them start with the poses I would imagine beforehand and let them do the rest. The chemistry of them is the greatest! I can see longing which was finally paid off for them when they were apart out of geography all the time.

Despite all the rush and the lack of preparation, I did enjoy working with this couple. So here is the moment of them I took impulsively while they were preparing for the photoshoot to the serious one. Hehe
<br/>
<br/>
These unplanned spontaneous images were so amusing I kept taking them.
