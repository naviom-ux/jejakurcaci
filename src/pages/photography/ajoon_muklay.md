Another super quick shoot with this bubbly couple Ajoon and Muklay.
We only got one hour session in the night because the schedule was very packed: they gotta go back home the next morning to Indonesia.
We decided to stroll around Shinjuku street and enjoy their last night by visiting a gift shop and also playing games.
Well, next time we should do a much longer photoshoot!

Here's another story of Ajoon and Muklay. Mostly I used to follow the couple and let them doing what they wanna do. Sometimes, they're just too shy to express their feelings yet I always ended up discovering adorable moments from them.
But being around Ajoon and Muklay was the exception! They even had their own ideas to do something that I never think of before. When we passed the payphone, Muklay went straight to it and did his act by calling someone and Ajoon was following him to act as if they had their own 'movie story' for themselves. Aah what a night! Thank you for the inspiration that impulsively gave to me!
